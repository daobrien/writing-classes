# Encryption and Authentication: Not Only for Spies

This is an exercise-based course that explores the concepts and methods necessary for successful encryption and decryption of various types of content, and also the successful authentication of different users to different types of systems. Modify as necessary...


* Course Objectives

To provide an introduction to encryption and [identity] authentication, identify their benefits and drawbacks, provide examples of current use, and how they might develop in the future.

* Audience

Nerds, people paranoid about secrecy and privacy, most government departments.

* Prerequisites

An interest in geeky things.
A certain level of paranoia is a benefit but not required.

## Identity Authentication

* Explain what it is and why it might be important.
